Always review these rules when analysis of an argument is taking place.

1. Is the argument based on verifiable facts and credible sources, or does it rely on personal evidence or opinions?
2. Does the argument make any unjustified leaps in logic, such as assuming causation from correlation, using circular reasoning or committing the slippery slope fallacy?
3. Is the argument attacking the character or qualifications of the person making the claim (ad hominem) instead of addressing the substance of the argument itself?
4. Does the argument use vague, ambiguous,  or imprecise language that could lead that could lead to misinterpretation or equivocation (hiding the truth by imprecise language), or is it loaded with the wanted conclusion?
5. Does the argument consider alternative perspectives and potential counterarguments, or does it present a false dichotomy (non-correlation), cherry-pick evidence, or overly generalize?

If the opposing argument passes these questions with no questions returning true: Continue by decompiling the argument.

1. What is the claim or thesis of the claim?
2. What are the premises or assumptions?
3. -Consider each premise or assumption individually with the claim.
4. -Consider given evidences individually with the claim.
5. ^ Deductive(definite conclusion) or inductive(probable conclusion) reasoning?
6. Does the argument oversimplify complex issues or ignore important counterarguments?
7. Are there any other plausible explanations or interpretations of the evidence?
8. Can the conclusion be challenged by counterexamples or contradictory evidence?
9. Are there any important points or perspectives that the argument overlooks or fails to address?

With the new information gathered here continue with formulating your argument.
When you have your argument look through these questions and only pass your argument through if all are true.

1. Is your argument based on credible verifiable evidence and reliable sources, avoiding anecdotal evidence(personal facts) or personal experiences as the sole basis for your claims?
2. Is your reasoning logically sound, avoiding leaps in logic, circular reasoning, or presuming the conclusion in your premise?
3. Ad hominem is not committed.
4. The language used is precise and specific, avoiding ambiguity, vagueness or equivocation(hidden truth by imprecise language) that could lead to misinterpretation or misleading conclusions.
5. Does your argument consider alternative perspectives and counterarguments, avoiding oversimplification, false dichotomies, or presenting only selective evidence that supports your position.


Keep in mind to always be open to changing your position if you realise that you're wrong. Use [[Current argument]] for more structured approaches. With the picture format of this in [[Argumentary construct.canvas|Argumentary construct]].
